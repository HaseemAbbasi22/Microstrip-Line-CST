# Microstrip-Line-CST
Microstrip transmission line simulation in CST Studio Suite
# Microstrip Line Simulation – CST Studio Suite

This project showcases the simulation of a **microstrip transmission line** using **CST Studio Suite**, designed and analyzed as part of my learning journey into high-frequency RF structures and microwave engineering.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To simulate and analyze the behavior of a microstrip line over a **1–5 GHz** frequency range, focusing on:
- **Effective Dielectric Constant**
- **Line Impedance**

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- CST Studio Suite project setup and solver configuration  
- Excitation port configuration for transmission lines  
- Analyzing S-parameters, impedance, and dielectric properties  
- Visualizing results and interpreting trends across frequency

---

## 📊 Results

### ✅ Effective Dielectric Constant (Real Part)
The simulation shows an increasing trend in the effective dielectric constant with frequency — a typical behavior due to dispersion in dielectric materials.

### ✅ Line Impedance (Magnitude)
Line impedance remains close to the ideal **50 Ω** across the sweep, indicating a well-matched microstrip design.
