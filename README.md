## üßæ Project Summary

This project focuses on designing and simulating a **microstrip transmission line** using CST Studio Suite. A microstrip line is a simple and widely used type of transmission line for carrying high-frequency signals, especially on PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards). The simulation covers frequencies from **1 GHz to 5 GHz**, analyzing key characteristics like **effective dielectric constant**, **impedance**, and **S-parameters**. Results show stable signal propagation, near-ideal 50Œ© impedance, and minimal reflection‚Äîindicating good signal integrity and proper line matching.

## üè≠ Industry Applications

Microstrip lines are fundamental components in **RF and microwave systems**. They are used in devices such as **smartphones**, **Wi-Fi routers**, **satellite and radar systems**, and **medical equipment** (like MRI machines). Industries rely on microstrip technology for applications like **antenna feeding**, **filters**, **amplifiers**, and **transceiver design** due to its compact size, ease of fabrication, and cost-effectiveness. This simulation provides a strong foundation for future work in high-frequency circuit and antenna design.
